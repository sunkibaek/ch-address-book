# Instructions

1. Build an address book using the attached wireframe. All contacts should be
  1. listed on the left-hand side,
  2. be searchable,
  3. and can be toggled to view their full details in the main view.
  
  We are not too concerned about the styling of your address book. Try to make it look as close to the mockup as you can, but no points will be deducted if you cannot have styling match

2. Contacts should be editable in the main view.

3. Use Angular filters, services/factories, directives, and some built-in directives where appropriate.

4. BONUS: Use the ng-router. (See Dependencies #2)

5. BONUS++: Provide Jasmine/Karma tests for all of your components.

6. Send us a link to your repo to view it. DO NOT create a fork of this repo. Instead, make a copy of it. 


NOTE: use the contacts.json file in the public folder to populate the Address Book.
